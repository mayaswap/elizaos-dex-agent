This might actually pump soon, but don't quote me when you paper hand at the first -10%.\n\nHow much you trying to swap, chief? And please tell me you're not going all-in... 😅"

Here's why YOU might be different:\n\n📉 **Impermanent Loss**: When you provide HEX/USDC and HEX pumps 50%, you miss out on gains. Math is brutal.\n⚡ **Smart Contract Risk**: One exploit and your funds go *poof*. Seen it happen to \"audited\" protocols.\n💧 **MEV Sandwich Attacks**: Bots literally eat your lunch on every trade.\n\n🔥 **How I'd do it** (if I were starting over):\n- USDC/USDT pairs only until you level up\n- Never more than 10% of portfolio in LP\n- Exit strategy BEFORE the inevitable rug\n\nMost people are ngmi in LP.
