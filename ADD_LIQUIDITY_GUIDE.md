## Why Pool Selection Matters

### 🔥 **Volume = Fees**
- Higher volume pools generate more trading fees
- The bot shows 24h volume for each pool
- Pool #1 (highest volume) is marked with 🔥

### 💰 **Different Fee Tiers**
- **0.25%** - Best for stable pairs, lower fees but higher volume
- **1%** - Balanced fee/volume ratio, most common
- **2%** - Higher fees, typically lower volume

### 📊 **APY Considerations**
- Higher APY doesn't always mean better returns
- Consider impermanent loss risk
- Volume consistency matters more than peak APY

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components:

1. **Pool Discovery**
   - Queries all pools for token pair
   - Sorts by 24h volume (descending)
   - Shows top 5 with key metrics

2. **Numbered Selection**
   - Users select by saying "pool 1", "#2", "number 3", etc.
   - Can combine with amount: "add 1000 HEX to pool 1"
   - Clear instructions provided

3. **Smart Token Ordering**
   - Automatically handles token order to match pool
   - Converts PLS to WPLS when needed
   - Calculates optimal amounts for both tokens

## Important Notes

### Pool Selection Tips:
- 🔥 **Higher volume = more fees** (usually pool #1)
- 📈 **Check APY** but don't chase unsustainable yields
- 💱 **Compare prices** across different fee tiers
- 🎯 **Consider your strategy** - stable vs volatile pairs

### Current Limitations:
- Shows maximum 5 pools (sorted by volume)
- Cannot create new pools (only add to existing)
- Must select a pool before proceeding
- Pool selection resets after 5 minutes of inactivity

## Examples of Pool Selection

### Basic Selection:
```
"pool 1"
"select pool 2"
"I choose #3"
"number 4"
```

### With Amount:
```
"add 1000 HEX to pool 1"
"provide 500 USDC to #2"
"pool 3 with 100 WPLS"
"1000 DAI in pool number 1"
```

### Range Specification (after pool selection):
```
"add 1000 HEX to pool 1 with concentrated range"
"pool 2 with 500 WPLS full range"
```
