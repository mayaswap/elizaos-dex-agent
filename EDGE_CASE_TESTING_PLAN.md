# Edge Case Testing Plan - Implementation Status

## ✅ **IMPLEMENTED EDGE CASE FIXES**

### 1. **Multiple Pending Transactions** ✅ FIXED
**Before**: User could create multiple pending transactions, causing confusion
**After**: Only 1 pending transaction allowed per user

```
Test Case:
User: "swap 100 USDC for HEX"
Bot: "Confirm? Transaction ID: tx_123"
User: "swap 200 PLS for USDT"  
Bot: "🔄 Cancelled 1 existing pending transaction. New trade: 200 PLS → USDT. Confirm?"
User: "yes" ← Clear which transaction
```

**Implementation**: SessionService now clears existing pending transactions when creating new ones.

### 2. **Expired Transaction Handling** ✅ FIXED
**Before**: Confusing error messages for expired transactions
**After**: Clear expiry messages with helpful guidance

```
Test Case:
User: "swap 100 USDC for HEX"
Bot: "Confirm? Expires in 5 minutes"
[7 minutes later]
User: "yes"
Bot: "⏰ Transaction Expired - Your quote has expired (quotes are valid for 5 minutes).
     Market prices may have changed. Create a new swap: 'swap 100 USDC for HEX'"
```

**Implementation**: Enhanced expiry detection with user-friendly recovery steps.

### 3. **Context Switching Mid-Transaction** ✅ FIXED  
**Before**: User could get confused asking other questions while transaction pending
**After**: Context-aware responses that prioritize pending transactions

```
Test Case:
User: "swap 100 USDC for HEX"
Bot: "Confirm? Transaction ID: tx_123"
User: "what's the price of PLS?"
Bot: "📊 I can get that price for you, but first - you have a pending transaction!
     Pending Trade: 100 USDC → HEX (Expires in 4 minutes)
     Reply 'yes' to confirm or 'no' to cancel, then I'll get the price"
```

**Implementation**: New `contextualResponseAction` handles this gracefully.

### 4. **Fuzzy Matching for Confirmations** ✅ FIXED
**Before**: Only recognized exact keywords like "yes" and "no"
**After**: Handles typos, variations, and ambiguous responses

```
Test Cases:
User: "yep" → Recognized as "yes"
User: "sure thing" → Recognized as "yes"
User: "nah" → Recognized as "no"
User: "maybe" → "I'm not sure what you mean. Please respond with 'yes' or 'no'"
User: "confirn" → Recognized as "confirm" (typo correction)
```

**Implementation**: New `fuzzyMatcher` utility with comprehensive confirmation detection.

### 5. **Ambiguous Response Handling** ✅ FIXED
**Before**: Unclear responses caused confusion
**After**: Clear guidance for ambiguous responses

```
Test Case:
User: "swap 100 USDC for HEX"
Bot: "Confirm?"
User: "i think so"
Bot: "🤔 I'm not sure what you mean
     You have a pending transaction: 100 USDC → HEX (Expires in 4 minutes)
     Please respond with 'yes' to confirm or 'no' to cancel"
```

**Implementation**: Ambiguous term detection with helpful guidance.

## 🧪 **COMPREHENSIVE TEST SCENARIOS**

### Scenario 1: Multiple Transaction Handling
```
1. User: "swap 100 USDC for HEX"
   Expected: Creates pending transaction

2. User: "swap 50 PLS for USDT" (before confirming first)
   Expected: Cancels first, creates new pending transaction

3. User: "yes"
   Expected: Confirms the PLS → USDT trade (most recent)
```

### Scenario 2: Expiry Edge Cases
```
1. User: "swap 100 USDC for HEX"
   Expected: 5-minute timer starts

2. [Wait 6 minutes]

3. User: "yes"
   Expected: "Transaction Expired" message with recovery options
```

### Scenario 3: Context Switching
```
1. User: "swap 100 USDC for HEX"
   Expected: Pending transaction created

2. User: "what's the price of PLS?"
   Expected: Context-aware response prioritizing pending transaction

3. User: "no" (cancel)
   Expected: Transaction cancelled

4. User: "what's the price of PLS?"
   Expected: Normal price response (no pending transaction)
```

### Scenario 4: Fuzzy Confirmation Matching
```
1. User: "swap 100 USDC for HEX"
   Expected: Pending transaction

2. Test various responses:
   - "yep" → Should confirm
   - "nope" → Should cancel  
   - "maybe" → Should ask for clarification
   - "confirn" → Should recognize as "confirm"
   - "absolutely" → Should confirm
   - "not really" → Should cancel
```

### Scenario 5: Wallet-First Flow
```
1. New User: "swap 100 USDC for HEX"
   Expected: Wallet creation prompt

2. User: "create wallet"
   Expected: Wallet created, session updated

3. User: "swap 100 USDC for HEX"
   Expected: Now works, creates pending transaction
```

### Scenario 6: Expiry Warnings
```
1. User: "swap 100 USDC for HEX"
   Expected: 5-minute timer

2. [Wait 4.5 minutes]

3. User: "what's my balance?"
   Expected: Context response with "URGENT: Less than 1 minute left!"
```

## 🔧 **MANUAL TESTING CHECKLIST**

### Basic Flow Testing

- [ ] Confirm with "yes" → Executes
- [ ] Cancel with "no" → Cancels

### Edge Case Testing
